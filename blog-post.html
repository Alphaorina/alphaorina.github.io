                                    <p>In 2018, I embarked on an adventure of a lifetime. I packed my bags and left my home in Kenya to study Technical Management at Obuda University in Hungary. As I stepped off the plane and took my first breath of Hungarian air, I knew that I was in for an unforgettable journey.</p>

                                </div>
                                    <p>One of the highlights of my time studying in Hungary was participating in the Erasmus Plus program in Turkey. This experience allowed me to broaden my horizons and learn about different cultures and perspectives.</p>
                                    <p>After completing my studies, I had the opportunity to intern at Avis Budget and gain valuable experience in the industry. Now, I am continuing my career in Automation Development.</p>
                                    <p>But my journey in Hungary was not just about academics. Budapest, the captivating capital city of Hungary, offered a vibrant and exhilarating student life. With its rich history, cultural attractions, and dynamic nightlife, Budapest stood out as an ideal destination for students from all corners of the world.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>One of the major advantages of studying in Budapest was its affordable cost of living. The city offered a budget-friendly environment that catered to the needs of students, covering everything from accommodation and food to transportation expenses.</p>
									<p>Budapest was home to renowned universities like <a href ="https://uni-obuda.hu/2022/08/08/summer-picnic-with-kenyan-students-from-obuda-university/"> <u>Obuda University</u>, E√∂tv√∂s Lor√°nd University and the Technical University of Budapest, which provided a wide range of programs in fields such as engineering, business, and the arts. The city‚Äôs academic offerings were diverse and catered to various interests and ambitions.</p>
									<p>Apart from academics, Budapest offered a plethora of activities to engage in. I immersed myself in the city‚Äôs captivating museums, galleries, and theaters, where I indulged in art and culture. The thriving music and arts scene kept me captivated, while the serene parks and green spaces provided a tranquil retreat from the bustling city life. And I couldn‚Äôt miss the opportunity to experience the famous thermal baths, a cherished tradition in Budapest.</p>
									<p>As the sun set, Budapest transformed into a vibrant nightlife hub. I could choose from a wide array of bars, clubs, and restaurants, including the unique ruin pubs set within the remnants of abandoned buildings. The nightlife scene in Budapest was both energetic and diverse, offering something for every taste and preference.</p>

									<p>In summary, my journey studying in Hungary was an incredible adventure filled with unforgettable experiences and opportunities. I am grateful for the chance to study at Obuda University and for all the amazing people I met along the way.</p>

Dopamine is great per se, however, I needed to do a detox‚Ä¶ Let me explain. I felt like my engine(brain) was overheating at the start. I had just completed my exams and still had some essays to submit. This took a toll on me. Pushing me to massively procrastinate‚Ä¶ </p>

                                    <p>I had adopted a myriad of bad habits at the end of the year and one of my resolutions in the beginning was to adopt better <a href =‚Äùhttps://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits‚Äù> systems</a>.  These habits comprised of eating junk, binging on Netflix, too much screen time and low self-improvement process. Remember I had mentioned I needed a detox? Well, I did not rush into it. The process was simple and made few tweaks every day such us decreasing triggers within my environment that would lure me into going back to the habits.</p>

                                    <p>One of the tweaks was through social media detox, which encompassed unfollowing whoever did not resonate with my WHY‚Ä¶. Like honestly why would I follow someone who does not add to my personal and career growth? Some of the productivity influencers like <a href = "https://aliabdaal.com"> <u>Ali Abdaal</u></a>, <a href ="https://stevenbartlett.com"> <u>Steve Bartlett</u> and <a href ="https://www.principles.com"> <u>Ray Dalio</u></a> have played a significant role in my online presence by rewiring my social media presence with value rather than absorbing ‚Äúuseless‚Äù content.</p>
                                    <p><i><b>Show me your friends and I will show you your future.</b></i></p>
                                    <p>I managed to beat the procrastination by adopting a recommended technique by Ali abdaal, where you do one thing every day that feels fulfilling and lifts off the burden off your shoulder. Another tip that worked for me is starting with my WHY. Yes!  Start with why is a book is written by Simon sinek that explains why you do something is more important than what you do or how you accomplish it.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>I will share with you some of the books that helped me streamline my systems;</p>
																   
					<dl>
					<dt><a href = "https://www.amazon.com/Love-Colour-Mythical-Around-Retold-ebook/dp/B07TT9MS95"> Love in color</a></dt>

					<dt><a href =‚Äùhttps://www.amazon.com/Essays-That-Will-Change-Think-ebook/dp/B01MYMUGQL‚Äù> 100 Essays</a></dt>
					<dd>-This book offers a wide range of perspectives to personal growth and how to think</dd>
					<dt><a href =‚Äùhttps://simonsinek.com‚Äù> Start with WHY</a></dt>
					<dd>-As previously mentioned, Simon sinek outlines how the limbic brain helps us to bring our inner passion to start on working on the WHY.</dd>

					<dd>-James clear gives a detailed structure on how small habitual tweaks can have tremendous impact if just done by an increment of 1% everyday</dd>
				        </dl>
																     <p>With the listed books, I eventually had my WHY outlined and began building systems. I triaged my to-do lists with the important tasks and got working on them based on the Eisenhower matrix.</p>

                                    <p>Moving to a new country is a cause for anxiety for many, whether it is for a job/new school. For me, it was a combination of 100 different emotions, being felt at once. Luckily on the waiting bay, I found a fellow mate (Derrick) who happened to be going to the same flight, same university, and same course altogether. Phew!!</p>

                                    <p>I came to Budapest not having any family in Hungary. I chose a city where I could be around different people and cultures without staying in my bubble of comfort. But as the saying goes, you will find a Kenyan at every corner of the world. I found friends already at my university who made my moving in easier. Soon I started to meet other international students with whom I could connect. I even happened to live with the very close ones in my second year. But not everyone has that experience. Some people feel isolated in the space they're in, and they choose to leave.</p>

                                    <p>Coming from a community where you always have people around you, to a space where you're alone 90% of the day can be daunting. The mental weight of starting over again in a new country was immense, with no dad and Mom to come to my rescue. I soon realized that a ship is safe at shore but that's not what it's built for. Moving to a new country is great. You experience so much, learn so many cultures, and that's great. But it always feels like a part of you has been left behind.</p>
                                    <p>Being away from home felt like being underwater. You can only hold your breath for so long. You realize, there is nothing more refreshing than the fresh rush of air filling your lungs. No matter how fast your legs can kick underwater, how your skin tingles at the sensation of life under the blue, your body was made for land, and there's no greater feeling than planting your feet on solid ground.</p>
                                    <p>And that's what home is. Solid Ground.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>Remember I mentioned that Kenyans are found at every corner of the world? well, I eventually met Kenyans (Students + workers) through the AKESH student community where we felt a little bit of home whilst away from it. The association created a space where people could laugh and relate to each other.</p>

In a sense, leaders need to be teachers. They also need to create experiences that together can accomplish something that neither you nor the other person could have accomplished individually. An excellent leader can create that feeling in others and give hope as they look at further opportunities.</p>

                                    <p>Unfortunately, nowadays, differences are evaluated with prejudices, stereotypes, and people from different cultures, different religious beliefs, different races are exposed to the violence of the dominant culture in many ways. The "Make a Tale Real" youth exchange project aims to show that the difference and diversity is not a means of discrimination, but on the contrary, is one of the most important elements of the enrichment of cultural heritage, color and social and even technological development. With the project, 38 participants from 6 different countries in Europe will come together and try to achieve this goal by using the theater methodology.

This project is also is the first step for TheARTer for Diversity movement which aims to collect all theater movements under one roof and encourage other organizations to work in this field by using the art as a tool to reach its goals.</p>
